# dataEntry
This applet reads in template excel sheet and outputs an excel datatable that indicates the movements evoked for each new site/ amplitude for the site on each row. 
Users will open the applet.  Then for each site or new amplitude for the site, click on the movements that were evoked. 
Users can click on more than one checkbox for each site or amplitude for the site.  
When done with each site or amplitude for the site, click on "next".  
When done with all data entry, click "done".  A excel file named "dataTable.xlsx" would be produced in the current directory.
